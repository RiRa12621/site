# Teardown

Follow these steps to delete your Liquid Metal Cluster and Platform.

## Step by step cleanup

:::info
The "step by step cleanup" is useful if you still want to re-use the environment.

If you don't care about or intend to keep any part of the local and remote
infrastructure, you can follow the "Just destroy everything" section below.
:::

1. Delete the cluster using `kubectl` and the cluster name:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
  ```

  :::caution
  Do NOT delete a CAPI-created workload cluster with `kubectl delete -f cluster.yaml`.
  :::

  This may take a moment as the CAPMVM controller reconciles all the MicroVMs.

  Output:
  ```bash
  cluster.cluster.x-k8s.io "lm-demo" deleted
  ```

1. Delete the management cluster.

  ```bash
  kind delete cluster --name lm-management
  ```

1. Tear down the Equinix infrastructure.

  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```

  :::tip
  Sometimes this destroy will attempt to delete some networking attributes
  before the associated devices are removed, and the command will error.
  Simply re-run the command to kill any remaining resources.
