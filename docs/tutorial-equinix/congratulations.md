You have just deployed a production-like Liquid Metal environment, and hopefully
learned enough to create and manage whichever system you need :tada:

## What's next?

- Continue reading the technical docs on how to provision Liquid Metal
  [hardware](/docs/component-info/hardware.md) and
  [clusters](/docs/component-info/capmvm.md) in production environments
  :mechanical_arm:
- Got some Raspberry Pi boards? Have a go at a [Liquid Metal Homelab build](https://warehouse-13.github.io/cosmic/docs/intro) :guitar:
- Check out the [architecture](/docs/category/architecture) of the various components :electric_plug:
- Get involved in the [Liquid Metal Community](/docs/community) :female-technologist:
