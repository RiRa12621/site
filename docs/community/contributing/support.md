# Developer Support

If at any point you get stuck, need help, or just want to chat through some ideas,
please reach out to the team or the community.

[Slack][slack] is the best way to get input from multiple people, but you can also
tag members of the [core team][team] on your assigned issue.

We are always happy to offer guidance through messages or jump on a call to work
things out :pear:.
