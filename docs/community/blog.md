# Got a cool Liquid Metal story to tell?

We'd love to help you share your experience!

Whether you have discovered an interesting use-case, contributed some neat code,
or just talk about how you set up and use LM day-to-day, we're
keen to either feature you directly on our [blog][blog] or link to an article you
posted elsewhere as part of our `liquid-metal-in-the-wild` series.

To find out more and set something up, reach out to a member of the [team][team] :tada:.
