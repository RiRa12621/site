Information about Platform and MicroVM networking.

## Platform networking options

Users are responsible for bringing and configuring their own hardware and networking
solutions.

We recommend the following network considerations for the platform:

- A private subnet for MicroVMs. Each MicroVM will request addresses on boot.
  Reserving public IPv4 addresses is unnecessary and wasteful for MicroVMs which
  will be part of a Kubernetes cluster.
- A single reserved IP for each cluster's load-balanced API endpoint. This can
  be public or private, depending on whether you wish the cluster to be exposed.
  A unexposed cluster with a private address, and suitable access such as a VPN,
  will be preferable to most.
- Starting the `flintlockd` services either within a private subnet, or ensuring
  that the service is secured with [authentication][mtls].

## MicroVM networking modes

Flintlock can create MicroVMs in two different network modes.

### Macvtap mode

On devices with the capability, MicroVMs can be created with their default interface
mapped to [`macvtap`][macvtap] interfaces in the host.

The devices are created in `bridge` mode, enabling inter-microvm traffic directly
between the taps without it passing through the host interface.

`macvtap` is the default option.

Configure `flintlockd` to be ready to create `macvtap` devices by starting the service with
the following in `/etc/opt/flintlockd/config.yaml`:

```yaml
parent-iface: enp0 # where the value is a wired interface on the host
```

When creating MicroVMs directly via flintlock, ensure the spec contains the following:

```json
...
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "device_id": "eth1",
        "type": 0 // 0 for macvtap
      }
    ]
...
```

When creating MicroVMs as part of a cluster via CAPMVM, ensure the spec contains the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MicrovmMachineTemplate
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      networkInterfaces:
      - guestDeviceName: eth1
        type: macvtap
```

### Bridge mode

Flintlock can optionally create MicroVMs in which the default interface within the guest
is mapped to a `tap` device attached to a `bridge` on the host.

![Liquid Metal Microvms bridge networking](/img/bridge.jpg)

Configure `flintlockd` to be ready to use a bridge to create `tap` devices by starting the service with
the following in `/etc/opt/flintlockd/config.yaml`:

```yaml
bridge-name: br0 # where the value is a bridge to a host interface
```

:::info
Both `bridge-name` and `parent-iface` can be set in `/etc/opt/flintlockd/config.yaml`.
The decision is made at MicroVM create time depending on which is requested via the API.
